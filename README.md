# 5V Regulated Power Supply – PCB Design Project

This project is a simple and efficient 5V power supply board designed using **KiCad**. It uses the LM7805 voltage regulator to provide a steady 5V DC output from a higher DC input (e.g., 9V–12V adapter or battery).

## ⚙️ Features

- Provides regulated 5V output
- Input voltage range: 7V to 12V DC
- LED indicator for power status
- Designed and routed in KiCad
- Output via terminal block for easy connection

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

- Understanding of voltage regulation using LM7805
- Schematic capture and PCB layout in KiCad
- Designing with basic components like resistors, capacitors, diodes, LEDs
- Generating Gerber files and PCB 3D visualization

## 📁 Files Included

- `.sch` – Schematic file
- `.kicad_pcb` – PCB layout file

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add USB output port
- Use switching regulator for better efficiency
- Include fuse or protection circuitry

## 📌 Notes

This project was completed as part of my early PCB design learning journey using KiCad. Feedback and suggestions are welcome!
